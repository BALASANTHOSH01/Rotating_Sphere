# Rotating Sphere

## Overview

Welcome to **Rotating Sphere**, my inaugural 3D project crafted for my internship at **Infomarki**. This project features a captivating 3D sphere that rotates dynamically, built using **React Three Fiber (R3F)**. Explore this visual marvel and see how modern web technologies bring 3D graphics to life!

## 🚀 Features

- **Dynamic Rotation**: A 3D sphere that continuously rotates, creating a mesmerizing visual effect.
- **Interactive Experience**: The scene responds to cursor movements, enhancing user interaction.
- **Modern Tech Stack**: Utilizes React Three Fiber for smooth and efficient 3D rendering.
- **Responsive Design**: Adaptable to various screen sizes and devices for a seamless experience.
